# ECE2112-Experiment-1

This repository is for the Experiment 1 of my ECE2112 - Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms course. The notebook uploaded contains Python codes that deal with different sample problems given, which consist of:

ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM - We were tasked to create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters
in alphabetical order.

EMOTICON PROBLEM - We were tasked to create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. When given a sentence
as a string, it should replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon

UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM - We were tasked to unpack a given list into three variables: first,
middle, and last, with the middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then, we should print all three
variables.
